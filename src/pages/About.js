        Welcome to my personal ecommerce portfolio website! This platform is
        built using React JS, a popular JavaScript library for building user
        interfaces. I am a developer and I've used this website as a showcase of
        my skills and experience in building ecommerce website and also to
        demonstrate my ability to work with modern technologies. On this
        website, you'll find a selection of fictional products, along with their
        details and pricing. While this website is not a real ecommerce
        platform, the functionality is similar to that of a real-world ecommerce
        site, including product browsing, shopping cart, checkout process and
        order confirmation. The website is also fully responsive, meaning it
        adjusts to any screen size, and it's accessible to users with
        disabilities. I am committed to open-source development, so the code for
        this website is available on GitHub. Feel free to take a look at my code
        and give me feedback or suggestions. You can access the codebase or contact me by
        following the links below. Thank you for visiting
        my portfolio website!
