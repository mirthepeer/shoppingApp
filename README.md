# Shopping App

Welcome to my portfolio project! This project is a demonstration of my skills as a front-end developer, featuring a dummy e-commerce website with a dynamic category filter, shopping cart system and order history feature. The website utilizes the React Context API and React Router for seamless navigation and a smooth user experience. The website contains dummy products, but showcases my ability to create a functional and visually pleasing e-commerce platform with order history feature that helps user to track their order history. Feel free to take a look around and check out my portfolio!
